So I just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Wedding Banquet, and honestly, I don't know whether to hug someone or throw a pie in their face. Is it too much to ask for straightforward emotions? Like, come on. Weddings are supposed to be joyful or chaotic – not constitutionally perplexing moral dramas set against the backdrop of cultural chaos. But here we are, my mind spinning more than a freaking dentist's drill.

First of all, can we talk about how weirdly relatable it is for a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 about a Taiwanese-American guy hiding his gayness from his traditional parents? And I say this as someone who can barely keep my cactus alive, let alone fool anyone about anything. It's like, I can't even hide my yawns during admin meetings, and this dude is orchestrating a whole fake marriage!

The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮's like a tug-of-war between heartfelt and downright absurd. Look, who wouldn't love to see two sets of parents force their kids into a marriage, complete with overwhelming banquets and out-of-nowhere saxophone solos? Because that’s normal, right? I felt like I was walking down an amusement park's hall of mirrors – nothing made sense, but it did? Ugh.

> Also, not to be dramatic, but the food scenes. Seriously. They had more emotions in those dumpling shots than in some of the year's supposed blockbuster tearjerkers. Ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 a bite of calamari translate more feelings than the last five rom-coms combined?

I must admit, by the end, I felt rather like a deflated beach ball. Only in this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 could a wedding, a supposed hallmark of tradition, pull off a riot of revelations. It's like, “Ha! You think you're getting a rom-com?” Nope, here’s some existential angst wrapped in father-son bonding and spicy noodles. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to catch this metaphoric roller coaster if you haven't. It won't fix your mid-life crisis, but might give it new flavor.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf(Gao We-tung's angst: %s
, undetermined);
    return 0;
}
```

So, all in all, do I recommend it? Sure, why not? It's not like we stumble upon such chaotic beauty every weekend, right? Get some popcorn, put your sarcasm pants on, and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   unfold like an awkward family reunion you can't decide if you should run from or embrace.
